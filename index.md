Change the title above AND IN THE _config.yml FILE (so that the page header in the GitHub Pages site automatically shows the site name).

{% assign labs = site.pages | where_exp:"page", "page.url contains '/Instructions/Labs'" %} {% for activity in labs  %}
- [{{ activity.lab.title }}]({{ site.github.url }}{{ activity.url }}) {% endfor %}
